* Pre-processing of the VOG gene and protein sequences using dbPrep_getDBs.py results not only in tagging the sequence headers with VOG identifiers, but also elimination of sequences from the download file that are NOT mapped to VOG identifiers (about 20% of them). The VOG database is updated on a regular basis. As of this writing, version 99 is the most recent. Version can be modified at the top of script dbPrep_getDBs.py.

* The pVOG database has not been updated since 2016. Therefore it is unncessary to re-run the pVOG scripts for updating this data set for multiPhATE.

* Because the Refseq Gene database is human centric, the VOG gene database is now to be considered a substitute for Refseq Gene. The dbPrep_getDBs.py script no longer downloads Refseq Gene.

* For VOG processing:
Based on the organization of the VOG data, it is necessary to:
1) Tag sequences with the VOG identifier(s); annotate hits with the VOG description (not the sequence description)
dbPrep_getDBs.py is the main script
dbPrep_getDBs.py        calls   dbPrep_vogTagFastas.py
dbPrep_vogTagFastas.py  imports dbPrep_vog
dbPrep_vog.py           imports dbPrep_fastaSequence
dbPrep_fastaSequence.py imports dbPrep_annotation

* For pVOG processing:
Based on the organization of the pVOGs data, it is necessary to:
1) Tag sequences with the VOG identifier(s); 2) Capture the sequence fastas and descriptions from NR (there are no VOG descriptions for the pVOGs).
dbPrep_createPvogFastaFile.py is the main script
dbPrep_createPvogFastaFile.py imports:
	dbPrep_annotation
	dbPrep_fastaSequence
	dbPrep_pVOG
dbPrep_consolidate.py - consolidates the hmm files; this functionality has been moved into dbPrep_getDBs.py
dbPrep_getLast3percent.py - queries remaining sequences from the NR database

* It is important to realize that the VOG identifiers between VOGs and pVOGs do not correspond.
